The Boxee-Voddler-Html5-Addon is a sub project of the Boxee-Voddler-Addon
aimed at exploring the possibilities of an html5 app to bring voddler to the Boxee platform.

inspired by apps like youtube-leanback
http://www.youtube.com/leanback

at the moment i've setup a boxee repo at:
http://d34dmeat.github.com/boxee

check it out and test the app.

It won't work though (at the moment i'm testing keybord mode)
